Our final project details an analysis of the effectiveness of streetlights on violent crime in the city of Boston.

In our submission, our 'code' folder includes all of our code files which were constructed in part using Leaflet libraries and a Bootstrap template. Within the 'code' folder, our 'data' folder contains all our datasets, the sources for which can be found on our website footer. 

We wrote the following scripts to clean and categorize the crime data, as well as calculate the distance between crimes and streetlights.

Outside of our folder structure we have our screencast video and our pdf of our final process book.

Part 1: A analysis of Boston crime statistics, with the ability to filter but day of the week, month of the year, and shooting instances.

Part 2: A analysis of crime statistics in terms of sunrise/sunset.

Part 3: A map of violent crime in relation to streetlight locations.

Part 4: A mathematical analysis of the distance being crime instances and the nearest streetlight.

All features for each visualization are explained in their respective sections.
