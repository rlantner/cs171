                        <p class="lead">
                            Research in Houston by Rice University<a href="https://kinder.rice.edu/sites/default/files/documents/Kinder%20Streetlights%20and%20Crime%20report.pdf"><sup>3</sup></a> suggests that while crimes against property often coincide with well-lit areas like shopping malls and airports,
                            number of crimes against people has an association with streetlight density: more light, less crime. (This is not necessarily a causal relationship, but correlated nonetheless.)
                            <br><br>
                            Does the phenomenon hold true in Boston?
                            <br><br>
                            The visualization below shows the number of crimes committed over a three-year period from 2016 to 2018.
                            We filter to assaults, injuries, and homicides, under the assumption that violent, public crimes against people are more likely to show seasonal and temporal patterns than crimes like fraud.
                            Circle size depicts crime count and color indicates night, dawn, day, and dusk, accounting for changing sunrise and sunset times in Boston over the year.

                            While hourly trends show low levels of violent crime in the morning with a ramp through the day, they do not reveal an obvious association between crime counts and "streetlight hours" (dusk to dawn).
                            However, the categorization of assaults, injuries, and homicides is subject to variability in officers' reporting and our own interpretation of the crime data descriptions.
                            The data for shootings, on the other hand, is more cut-and-dry.
                            When we filter explicitly to crimes where shootings occurred, we can see in the visualization below that counts are generally higher at night, specifically during summer months.

                                As we can see there is an increase in violent crimes against people taking place during nighttime

                                    Now we need to visualize the proximity at which streetlights are to these instances

                        <p class="lead"> Calculating the average distance between crimes and streetlight locations shows
                            that, overall, crimes typically occur about 30 feet from a streetlight. Based on the previous
                            research cited above, we predicted that crimes against persons would show greater average
                            distances from streetlights than crimes against property. Our analysis reveals a more complicated
                            pattern, as can be seen in the visualization below. The most violent crime type – those resulting
                            in injury or death – does have the highest average distance from a streetlight (34ft). However,
                            not all crimes against persons show this pattern. Assaults are in fact closer on average to
                            the nearest streetlight (31ft) than are thefts (32ft). This suggests that streetlights may have
                            a deterring effect on the most violent of crimes, but are not as effective at crime prevention
                            as one might hope.</p>

                        <p class="lead">What can we learn from this data? It’s clear that streetlights do in fact have
                            an impact on violent crimes that take place at night, but the fact is that most crimes in
                            fact do take place during daytime hours, when streetlights have no impact. While increasing
                            the number of streetlights in poorly lit areas of any city can prevent pockets of increased
                            violent crime rates, every city should also be focussing on crime prevention methods such as
                            increasing minimum wage and gun control initiatives.
